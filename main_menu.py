    Welcome to the Weather Console App
    -------------------------------------------------
    Note: please skip to the \"TL;DR\" section if you want to start tinkering right away.

    The purpose of this app is to provide weather information to its users. Users can perform either a single location search or an area search.
    
    For single location searches, users can either search for locations by City Name or Zip Code.
    To jump right into a single location search, please enter "s" into the command line prompt.
    Once you select one of the options, you will be provided more detailed instructions.

    For area searches, users can search for weather information for zip codes within a user-designated mile radius from a chosen
    zip code. To jump right into an area search, please enter "a" into the command line prompt.

    If you require assistance at any time, please enter "h" into the command line prompt to display a help menu.

    To return to this page at any time, enter "m" into the command line prompt.

    Lastly, to exit the app at any time, enter "x" into the command line prompt.

    Thanks for checking us out. Happy weathering!
